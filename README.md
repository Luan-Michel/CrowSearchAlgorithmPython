# CrowSearchAlgorithmPython
A Python implementation of Crow Search Algorithm

## Definition

Crow Search Algorithm is a search algorithm proposed by Alireza Askarzadeh, in the year 2016, as a new metaheuristic method aimed at solution of the most varied engineering optimization problems. Askarzadeh based his idea on the behavior of crows to develop the algorithm. Therefore this can be classified as bioinspired (inspired by nature).

A crow is an animal known to collect its food and when necessary to hide this food so that other predators do not have the opportunity to steal your food. This feature is developed by the fact that they watch other birds and where these birds store their stock of food, and as soon as the animals are no longer around, the crows come to the place and steal the food. Therefore, because they have these characteristics, the crows they understand the need to hide their food. 

In this sense, [Askarzadeh (2016)][1] defines 4 principles that form the basis of thinking for the construction of the algorithm:

- Crows live in flocks;
- Crows memorize the position of their hiding place;
- Crows follow each other to steal food;
- Crows protect your stock (by a probability).
